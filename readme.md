# Minecraft Ballistics Project
## General Info

Welcome to the rewrite of Sascha_T's SGM project, this time with slightly more organised project structure and Forge support. \
Please don't be mad at me if the progress is a little slower this time around as I want to keep myself from unnecessarily rushing the project, potentially causing complications down the line.


## ETA: ???
